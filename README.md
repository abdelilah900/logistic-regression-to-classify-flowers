## Logistic regression to classify flowers
What is Logistic Regression?
The logistic regression statistic modeling technique is used when we have a binary outcome variable. For example: given the parameters, will the student pass or fail? Will it rain or not? etc.

So, though we may have continuous or categorical independent variables, we can use the logistic regression modeling technique to predict the outcome when the outcome variable is binary.

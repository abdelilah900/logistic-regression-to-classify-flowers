## Logistic regression to classify flowers
### What is Logistic Regression?
The logistic regression statistic modeling technique is used when we have a binary outcome variable. For example: given the parameters, will the student pass or fail? Will it rain or not? etc.

So, though we may have continuous or categorical independent variables, we can use the logistic regression modeling technique to predict the outcome when the outcome variable is binary.

Letâ€™s see how the algorithm differs from linear regression (Module 2). Linear regression statistical model is used to predict continuous outcome variables, whereas logistic regression predicts categorical outcome variables. Linear regression model regression line is highly susceptible to outliers. So, it will not be appropriate for logistic regression.
